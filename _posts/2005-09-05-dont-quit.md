Don't Quit 永不放弃

When things go wrong as they sometimes will, 

人生的事常有出错之时  
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill, 

你前行的道路似乎老是上坎爬坡  
When the funds are low,and the debts are high, 

当囊中羞涩债台高筑  
And you want to smile,but you have to sigh, 

你想笑，却不得不唉声叹气  
When care is pressing you down a bit--

忧愁使你无法抬头  
Rest if you must,but don't you quit! 

如果需要，你可以休憩，但不能放弃！

Success is failure turned inside out,

成功是从失败中反复而来  
The silver tint is the clouds of doubts, 

是疑虑的乌云里闪现的银色光彩  
And you can never tell how close you are,

你永远不能辨识成功离你有多远  
It may be near when it seems afar, 

看似遥远，或许近在眼前  
So,stick to the fight when you are hardest hit,-- 

因此，当你遭到最沉重打击时，坚持战斗到底  
It's when things go wrong that you mustn't quit. 

愈是不顺，愈不能放弃！
