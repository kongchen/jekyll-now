> real time signals, the executable used on Linux 2.2.19+. By default no more than 1024 POSIX realtime (queued) signals can be outstanding in the entire system. This is insufficient for highly loaded servers; it's therefore necessary to increase the queue size by using the kernel parameter /proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max However, starting with Linux 2.6.6-mm2, this parameter is no longer available, and for each process there is a separate queue of signals, the size of which is assigned by RLIMIT\_SIGPENDING.
